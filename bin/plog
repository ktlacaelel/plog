ERROR!
  No logs given, I have nothing to do!

HELP?
  The "plog" ( production log ) executable receives one option.
  This must be a directory containing one or more production logs.
  Only logs in the first level will be parsed.
  Recursive reading is not allowed

USAGE:
  $ plog directory_with_logs/

abort banner if ARGV.size != 1
Plog::Cli.new(ARGV[0]).run!
